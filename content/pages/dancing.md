Title: CyberPunk
Slug: cyberpunk-game

When _Van Haastrecht Manufacturing_ put out a job to nick some blueprints from _Oracle Motors_ so they could get a leg up on a new auto, you thought it'd be a piece of piss. All you needed to do was connect to the Net, visit _The Salt Traders_, and bosh--Robert's your mother's brother.

Instead, your deck got torn in half by that fucking puppet _Death's Head_ because you refused to "pay tribute" when crossing into its "domain", so now you've spent **hours** slogging through an underslum in the Smokestacks looking for some phreak named _Count Hackula_ (for fuck's sake) who has a half-price Vender you can have for a favour.

Down here, it's the worst kind of dark, because it's actually half-lit (both in space and in time) by the harsh, sputtering orange signage of an abandoned _Zippy's_. Unfortunately that means you didn't notice that you'd stumbled onto a horrific ritual being conducted by the Church of the Unholy Carcinogen.

One of them is wearing a pristine, vintage, and **unbelievably** illegal _Okuda_ mood console. It appears to currently be set to "ecstasy" and the electrodes stimulating the priest's pulsating temples hum so loud it sounds like screeching. A technical grimoire full of pentagrammic code is open on the floor next to the poor bastard they're trying to infect.

Oh right. The rest of them--five, looks like--are wearing plastic Smiley masks with flecks of paint crumbling off, and holding guns. And they don't look happy. ... well, they do, actually, but you know what I mean.

You roll initiative, because it looks like once again you're gonna be

### Dancing With Bullets Under A Neon Sun

>This is a game set in a city. You were born in
this city and you will die there, as your parents
did and your kids will after you (if you have any).
There isn’t a way out—it’s impossible.

Your goal is to make the best of your time here. For most, that means to grab as much cash as you can before getting topped. But for some, maybe there's more to it.

So.

Who are you?

Anyone can connect to the Net, but phreaks’ skills are unparalleled—leagues beyond their competition and bordering on the supernatural.

The physical embodiments of distant AI called puppeteers, puppets come in a countless variety of shapes and sizes, customized to the puppeteers’ aesthetic.
##### SHARKS
Expert con artists, sharks can get anyone to trust them right up until they’re robbed blind.
